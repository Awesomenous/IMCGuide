# IMC Data Analysis Pipeline

**Author**: Oscar  
**Compiled**: 2024-10-01

## Overview of the IMC Data Analysis Pipeline

This guide provides a detailed overview of an analysis pipeline designed to process and analyse single-cell data obtained from Imaging Mass Cytometry (IMC). It covers the entire workflow from data pre-processing to celltype analysis, ensuring users can extract meaningful biological insights from multiplexed imaging datasets. The pipeline is implemented across several platforms and software, including **Python**, **ImageJ**, **R** and **CellProfiler**. 

The code can be accessed [here](https://github.com/CVR-MucosalImmunology/IMC).

## Structure of this Guide

The workflow is divided into the following key sections:

1. **Part A**: extraction and processing of raw IMC images 
2. **Part B**: analysis of cell data in **R**

For the full code, please refer to the GitHub repository.
